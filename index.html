                <p>Omori is an RPG horror game created by the indie game studio OMOCAT. The plot revolves around Sunny, a lonesome
                teenage boy who explores a vibrant, alternate reality in his dreams. This game, while colorful, has a depth
                to the plot that exposes the terrors of mental instability and its effects not only on one's perception
                of reality, but also the relationships they hold within it.

                <p> Without spoiling, I will say that this game
                does an amazing job at depicting poor mental health from both an internal and external perspective. Despite
                this, it also maintains lots of lightheartedness with the characters' relationships and humorous moments
                that further emphasize the contrast of Sunny's dream world and his reality. The visuals, music, and storywriting all complement eachother very well to create an immersive and addictive experience. Additionally, Omori's RPG element is unique
                in itself compared to other titles, as it utilizes each character's emotions to determine their performance in
                battle. This is one of my favorite features of the game because it brings realism and humanity to the characters, and
                makes the fights more meaningful and strategic (instead of a regular turn-based event the player can rush through). I recommend that anyone play this game not only for its meaningful story, but also the personal experience they can have from exploring each reality and moment through Sunny's eyes.
