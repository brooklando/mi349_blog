            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Omori is an RPG horror game created by the indie game studio OMOCAT. The plot revolves around Sunny, a lonesome teenage boy who explores a vibrant alternate reality in his dreams as an alter-ego named Omori. In this dream world, titled “Headspace”, he and his friends are enjoying a picnic when shortly afterwards they discover that their friend Basil is missing. Together, Omori and his friends venture throughout Headspace in hopes of finding their friend.</p>
            <p>Throughout Omori’s journey, in addition to Sunny’s when he wakes up to experience the real world, (called “Faraway Town”), players will soon realize that the colorful attitude posed by the game at the beginning is not the true essence of the plot. The truth is that the game, being deemed as “horror”, has many dark elements that expose the terrors of mental instability and its effects on not only one’s perception of reality, but also the relationships they hold within it.</p>
            <h3>Overall Verdict:</h3>
            <p>Without spoiling, I will say that this game does an amazing job at depicting poor mental health, from both an internal and external perspective. It also still maintains lots of lightheartedness with the characters’ relationships and humorous moments that act as a contrast of Sunny’s dream world and his reality. The visuals, music, and story writing all complement each other very well to create an immersive and addictive experience. I recommend that anyone play this game not only for its meaningful story, but also the personal experience they can have from exploring each reality and moment through Sunny's eyes. Throughout the game, players will discover the significant depth of the plot and the individuality of the characters, where eventually secrets will all come together towards a conclusion that entirely depends on the player themselves.</p>
            <h3>Why It Stands Out:</h3>
            <p>Besides its general immersive and personal quality, this game especially stands out because of its RPG element. Unlike other turn-based RPG titles, Omori uses character emotions as a determinant of how both Sunny/Omori and his friends fight in the game. For example, if one of the characters is angry, it causes their attack stats (damage given) to rise but their defense to lower (damage resisted). The emotions characters experience will have a significant advantage to certain stats, and a disadvantage to others. However, if a character is neutral, their stats can only be affected by what weapons, items, and armor they possess. Additionally, these emotions can be either stronger or weaker when fighting against opponents with certain emotions. Happy will overcome angry, sad will overcome happy, and angry will overcome sad. This element is especially unique because it further provides a personal gameplay, adding humane qualities to each character that allows the player to feel an immersive connection. It also plays a significant part in the plot when it comes to presenting themes of mental health to the player.</p>

                <h2>Fallout 4 Review</h2>

            <p><img alt="FALLOUT 4 Cover Picture" src="images/fallout-4.jpg"></p>
            <p>Fallout 4 is an open-world, action RPG game that takes place in a world after nuclear warfare. The protagonist, created by the player through looks, personality, and skills, lives a normal life with their family until the bombs drop. Their family evacuates to an underground vault where their family is frozen in cryogenic tubes, and they wake up to find that not only their spouse was murdered, but also their son was taken from them. Depressing, right?</p>
            <p>However, the protagonist regains their composure, determined to find their son within the wastelands. They meet many different companions, enemies, and they make choices that are detrimental to their story and its ending.</p>
            <h3>Overall Verdict:</h3>
            <p>I think Fallout 4 has its flaws, but overall is a great game that allows the player to choose their own journey to fully immerse themselves in the post-apocalyptic world. I may be a little biased though, considering open-world role playing games are my favorite genre, but this also allows some room for criticism when it comes to evaluating this game. The open-world setting is well designed, and truly does feel like a wasteland, but it lacks detail in comparison to other games in the Fallout series. Not necessarily through aesthetics, but rather encounters and relationships with the NPCs in the world.  It does allow for the player to make their own choices and paths, but is lacking the impact these choices may have with the gameplay. In comparison, Fallout New Vegas is far more detailed with dialogue, choices, consequences, story writing, and endings. Even the slightest difference in a dialogue choice can greatly affect the events and endings in New Vegas, but in Fallout 4 dialogue has little involvement unless its an obvious point in time where the decision has an impact. I would highly recommend Fallout 4 to anyone interested in open-world environments, first-person shooters, or role playing games.</p>
            <h3>Why It Stands Out:</h3>
            <p>It has more modern FPS mechanics, while still maintaining the customizable, choice-dependent RPG experience. In other words, it teeters between Call of Duty and Skyrim. There’s characters that the player will grow to love (whether literally through the game’s romance mechanics or figuratively), and lots of lore and background to both these characters and the world. I would recommend for anyone to play this game, but especially those looking for a sweet balance between FPS gameplay and an individualized roleplaying experience.</p>

            <p>I personally have twice as many as those hours. Yeah I know, I'm cool.</p>
