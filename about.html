        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p>I'm a Sophomore at Michigan State University pursuing a bachelor's degree in Information Science!
            I like long walks on the beach (I can't swim), refreshing bike rides along the campus river trail (I don't know how to
            ride a bike), and thrilling sessions of rock climbing! (I'm terrified of heights and nature)
        </p>
        <p>I also really, really love video games.</p>

        <h2>About Anti-Spoil Analyzing</h2>
        <p>I've made this blog as a way to remind myself of the amazing games I've played throughout my life, but also to
            provide an unprofessional and honest opinion about these games. Why seek professional opinion when you can get the opinion
            of someone just as casual as you? (No offense). Anti-Spoil Average, as the title says, operates as a spoil-free source 
            of gaming reviews from the average person. I hate spoilers just as much as you do, so you're safe with me (and my opinion, of course!)
        </p>
